  "description": "The MClimate 16A Switch & Power Meter LoRaWANÂ® is a compact 16A relay and electricity meter. The device is small enough to fit behind most wall switches and power equipment, enabling you to automate, track, and control your electrical appliances. This is possible as the device has 4 terminals L, N, N, Lout, and it works in a way that connects and disconnects Lout from L. With an overheating protection mechanism, FUOTA (Firmware Upgrades Over The Air), and operation in LoRaWAN Class C, the MClimate 16ASPM is ideal for rapid building retrofitting.\n"
